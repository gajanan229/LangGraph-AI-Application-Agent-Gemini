# Automated Application Co-Pilot

## Vision
The Automated Application Co-Pilot is a personal assistant that removes the busy-work from internship and co-op applications.  It automatically scouts new postings, crafts role-specific resumes & cover letters with generative AI, and can even submit the application on your behalf – all from a single web dashboard.

By turning a multi-hour chore into a few button-clicks, the Co-Pilot lets you focus on interview preparation and skill-building instead of formatting documents and filling portals.
